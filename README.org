#+title: Deepu Mohan Puthrote's dotfiles

This is how I manage my configurations between multiple laptops. Works with
macOS only for now.

This installs and setups most packages and tools I use, importatly =emacs= and
=fish= shell.

* Install

  #+begin_src sh
    curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WarFox/dotfiles/master/setup.fish | fish
  #+end_src


  #+begin_src sh
    curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WarFox/dotfiles/master/setup.sh | sh
  #+end_src
